Follow these instructions to install Boost and CGAL, except use Boost 1.40 and CGAL 3.5.1:
http://acg.cs.tau.ac.il/cgal-at-tau/installing-cgal-and-related-programs-on-windows

If you are missing CGAL/compiler_config.h, you can use the following: http://bwta.googlecode.com/files/compiler_config.h

Checkout BWTA from the svn: http://code.google.com/p/bwta/source/checkout .

If you don't have Qt installed or don't wish to access the debug renderings, remove #define DEBUG_DRAW 1 from functions.h

Build as release.
