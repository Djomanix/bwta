If you are missing CGAL/compiler_config.h, you can use the following: http://bwta.googlecode.com/files/compiler_config.h

In file segment_delaunay_graph_2.h, edit line 1237 and replace "protected" with "public".

Checkout BWTA from the svn: http://code.google.com/p/bwta/source/checkout .

If you don't have Qt installed or don't wish to access the debug renderings, remove #define DEBUG_DRAW 1 from functions.h
