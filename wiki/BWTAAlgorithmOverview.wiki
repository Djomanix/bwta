== Base location algorithm ==

1. Read mineral and vespene geyser locations and buildability array in from BWAPI.

2. Group minerals by proximity into clusters.

3. For each mineral cluster, determine best valid build tile position for base location.

4. On game start, get minerals and vespene geysers from BWAPI and attach them to base locations.

== Region-Chokepoint algorithm ==

1. Read walkability array in from BWAPI.

2. Simplify walkability array

2. Extract unwalkable polygons

3. Simplify polygons

4. Construct voronoi diagram of line segments from edges of polygons

5. Discard part of voronoi diagram inside polygons

6. Approximate parabolas in voronoi diagram with line segments

7. Insert voronoi diagram into arrangement with polygons

8. Discard useless segments of voronoi diagram.

9. Determine which nodes of voronoi diagram are region nodes

10. From regions determine best chokepoint nodes (narrowest nodes) between regions.

11. From chokepoint nodes find end points of choke points so it spans the gap.

12. Wall off each chokepoint in the arragement.

13. Faces that have region nodes become region polygons.

14. Tell each base location what region it is in.
