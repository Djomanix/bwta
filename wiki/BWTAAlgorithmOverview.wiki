Base location algorithm
1. Mineral locations and buildability array in from BWAPI.

2. Group by proximity into clusters.

3. For each mineral cluster, determine best valid build tile position for base location.


Region-Chokepoint algorithm.

1. Read walkability array in from BWAPI.

2. Simplify walkability array

2. Extract unwalkable polygons

3. Simplify polygons

4. Construct voronoi diagram of line segments

5. Discard part of voronoi diagram inside polygons

6. Approximate parabolas in voronoi diagram with line segments

7. Insert voronoi diagram into arrangement with polygons

8. Determine which nodes of voronoi diagram are region nodes

9. From regions determine best chokepoint node

10. Wall off each chokepoint in the arragement and determine sides of choke point.

11. Faces that have region nodes become region polygons.
